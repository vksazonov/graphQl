Here is a small chat app written on GraphQl, apollo-server-express, node.js, written in Typescript
There are three types:
  Forum: each one has a 
    -personal id, 
    -name,
    -private (you can decide to make it private or not)
    -admin (a person who has created forum), 
    -an array of users who have joined the forum,
    -an array of messages which are written in forum,
    -an array of requests (we need them if the forum is private)

  User: each uxser has a
    -personal id,
    -username,
    -picture,
    -age,

  Message: each message has a
    -personl id,
    -text of the message,
    -sentAt(exact date of creating a message)
    -user(a User who wrote a message)

There are six Querries covering all the requests in the task:
  -getAllUsers gives you back all registered users
  -getUserById gives you theuser you try to find
  -getJoinedForums gives you all forums that you have joined
  -getAllNonPrivateForums gives you all forums exept private forums
  -watchMessages gives you all messages if you have joined the forum,
  -getForumMembers gives you all members who joined the forum

There are six Mutations covering all the requests in the task:
  -createForum creates a new forum, making the person who created it an admin,
  -joinForumById joines the forum, but if it is private, you are sending a request,
  -acceptRequest transfers you from request array to members array
  -refuseRequest takes you out of the request array
  -createMessage creates a new message in forum
  -createUser creates a new user

To install all the packages you need to write:
  - npm i

To run the server you need to write:
  - npm start

Enjoy =)
